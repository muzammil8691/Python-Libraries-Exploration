NumPy Libraries Exploration

This repository is dedicated to exploring and practicing the core functionalities of NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. Throughout this project, I have explored various essential topics, including:

Basic Data Structures in NumPy: Understanding key structures like arrays, their properties, and benefits for numerical operations.

Array Creation: Methods to create arrays from lists, ranges, and specific functions for generating random arrays or arrays of specific values.

Indexing and Slicing: Techniques for accessing and modifying elements in arrays, including multidimensional arrays.

Array Operations: Performing arithmetic, logical, and statistical operations on NumPy arrays.

Broadcasting: Understanding how operations can be automatically applied over arrays of different shapes.

Reshaping Arrays: Techniques to reshape arrays, transpose, and manipulate dimensions.

Linear Algebra: Leveraging NumPy for matrix operations, solving linear equations, and performing matrix decompositions.

Aggregation and Statistics: Using NumPy functions for summarizing data, calculating mean, median, standard deviation, and more.

Vectorization: Optimizing calculations by avoiding loops and utilizing vectorized operations.

Handling Missing Data: Efficiently dealing with missing or NaN values within arrays.

Random Sampling: Generating random numbers, sampling from distributions, and random permutations.

This repository serves as a hands-on guide for mastering the numerical and matrix operations essential for data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. It reflects my progress in continuous learning and application of NumPy.
